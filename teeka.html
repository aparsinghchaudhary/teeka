          <p>Skills are common. Talent is rare.

            Hard work without talent is a shame, but talent without hard work is a tragedy.
            
            Hidden talent counts for nothing. 
            Talent is only the starting point.If you’re young and talented, it’s like you have wings.
            Hard work beats talent when talent fails to work hard
            Talent is what God put inside you. Skill is what you’ve done with what God put inside you. People applaud talent but pay for skills.

            I really believe that everyone has a talent, ability or skill that he can mine to support himself and to succeed in life.Put yourself on view. This brings your talents to light.Genius does what it must, and Talent does what it can. Talent is a tenant in the house owned by genius.Talent is what you possess; genius is what possesses you.I have no special talents. I am only passionately curiousTalent is a gift, but character is a choice.Toil to make yourself remarkable by some talent or other.Talent is an accident of genes and a responsibility. Our opportunities to do good are our talents. </p></div>

        <p><div data-aos="zoom-out-up"  data-aos-duration="1500"> Knowledge is something that will serve you your whole life. The most powerful thing in the world is knowledge because it can create and destroy life on earth. Moreover, knowledge helps us distinguish between humans and animals. Knowledge is the ability to use your knowledge to help others.There are very few people out there who truly understand the importance of knowledge. Every educated person is not knowledgeable, but every knowledgeable person is educated. This statement may sound weird but it’s true. In today’s world, almost everyone is educated still they do not have knowledge of the subject that they have studied.

          Besides, Knowledge is something that helps you drive a car, ride a bike, solve a puzzle, etc. Knowledge is something that prevents us from making the same mistake twice. It is not something that you can buy from you have to earn it.
          
          The knowledge is something that increases the more you share it. It protects your intellectual capital that is your knowledge. Likewise, humans have used their knowledge to create things that we can’t imagine a few centuries back. It helps us to convert our ideas into reality and also it helps us to reach the success that we desire in our life.

Moreover, knowledge assists us to differentiate between what is right and what is wrong. It helps us to overcome our faults, weaknesses, and dangerous situation in life. Also, a person with knowledge is more mentally and morally sound than people with money and less knowledge.

Besides, Knowledge is a very important tool to get positive changes in society or country. Knowledge gives us a vision of our future and what we can do in it. All the countries in the world that use technologically developed tools and machinery and many other things is the result of the knowledge. Weapons and bomb do not make a country powerful but knowledge does.

The growth and development of a nation do not depend on the arms and weaponry the country has. But with the amount of knowledgeable person it has and it is possible only because of the power of knowledge.</div></p></br>

        Facts related to culture, society, civilization, the human body, the animal kingdom, space, automobiles, cuisine, communities, countries, languages, current affairs, and so on are all considered general knowledge.
        
        Good general knowledge is helpful to students as it is an important part of interviews, competitive exams, and group discussions. General knowledge of facts helps students participate in discussions and debates with confidence.
